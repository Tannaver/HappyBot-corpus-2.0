- - What is the difference between IT and CSE?
  - The major  difference between both these field is that IT deals with the application of computing technology to real life processes, while,  Computer Science deals with the science that facilitates these applications. To make it short and simple, Computer Science is the creation of software and hardware by using different programming skills. On the other hand, IT is just the selection of the proper software or hardware for the task.
