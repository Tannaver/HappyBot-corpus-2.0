- - What is Computer Science?
  - Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. 
    It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies the theory of 
    computation and the design of software systems.
- - What is CSE?
  - Computer science is the study of processes that interact with data and that can be represented as data in the form of programs. 
    It enables the use of algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer scientist studies the theory of 
    computation and the design of software systems.

- - Difference between CSE and IT
  - The major  difference between both these field is that IT deals with the application of computing technology to real life processes, while,  
    Computer Science deals with the science that facilitates these applications. To make it short and simple, Computer Science is the creation of 
    software and hardware by using different programming skills. On the other hand, IT is just the selection of the proper software or hardware 
    for the task.
